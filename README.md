# Cardiac_Arrhytmia_Classification_by_LSTM_and_BLSTM_from_Raw_PPG_Signals
This repository hosts an RNN-based model for classifying cardiac arrhythmias using PPG signals. Trained on PhysioNet data, it detects arrhythmias like bradycardia, tachycardia, and more. Features include signal preprocessing, two RNN architectures (LSTM, BLSTM), and a GUI for predictions.
